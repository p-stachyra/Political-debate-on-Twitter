A fraction of correctly classified emotions: model's accuracy

                The performance metric is based on how well the model is able to predict the most dominant emotion embedded in a tweet. 
                To assess that, 50 tweets were sampled randomly and labelled manually. 
                If a manual evaluation assigns anger to a tweet and model predicted disgust, it is not counted as an error and vice versa. 
                It is because these labels are very close to each other and even a human being might have a problem to tell these two.

                Accuracy: 0.860.
                The number of studied samples: 50.
                The fraction of all tweets: 0.002.
